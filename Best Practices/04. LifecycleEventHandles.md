## OnInitialize

Occurs after checking the permission of the user to access the Screen, but before navigating to the Screen and fetching data. In Blocks, it occurs after the navigation. You can use it to initialize the Screen or Block by setting its default data.

## On Ready
Occurs after the Screen or Block DOM is ready, before the transition starts.


## OnRender

Occurs right after the Screen or Block On Ready event handler and every time the data of a Screen or Block changes. You can use it to update some third-party component.

## On After Fetch
Occurs after an Aggregate or Data Action has finished fetching data but before this data is rendered on the Screen or Block. You can use it to act upon the retrieved data.

## On Parameters Changed

Occurs in a Block anytime the parent Screen or Block changes one of its input parameters. Changes to the input value inside the block do not trigger this event handler. You can use it to react to changes in the Block parameters, such as to update variables.

## On Destroy

Occurs before destroying a Screen or Block and removing it from the DOM. You can use it to implement logic when the component is disposed, such as to remove event listeners.
