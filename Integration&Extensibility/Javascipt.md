# Javascript

- JavaScript code can be used in CLIENT actions of Reactive and Mobile apps through the JavaScript element.


- Input and output parameters are accessed in JavaScript code through the predefined object "$parameters". 

- $parameters – Contains the input and output parameters defined for the current JavaScript element.

- $actions – Contains references to client actions callable from the current JavaScript element scope (client actions either defined in the current module or referenced from another module, like system actions).

- $roles – Contains all the custom-defined roles for the current module.

- $public – Contains objects instantiating all public JavaScript API classes and modules.

- Other objects commonly available in JavaScript in a browser context can also be used, such as "window", "document", "JSON" and "RegExp" objects.
